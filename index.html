                      <p class="card-text card_text_j">It's amazing how a professor can change your insights about something in so a drastic way, before taking CS50<br/>
                        I took a few little courses about programming in Python and took a national programming country program where I learned a lot of things but those things were in my brain like a layer of paint, multiple things like what exactly was an array or an object were in my brain in a very confusing way.
                        <br/>But after seeing professor David J. Malan explaining how memory, pointers, variables, structures, algorithms, and all those low-level concepts work. That was the exact thing I needed with all his analogies and his emotion telling people around the world how we are here today with our lovely computers!.</p>

                      <p class="card-text card_text_j">So the tideman problem when I remember this a mix of feelings come to me.<br/>
                        Feelings like excitement, fear, anger, sadness without a doubt this was the hardest challenge for me,
                         I haven't finished the course yet, but on any other week I fell my head at that limit.<br/>
                         Like when I had to think in two-dimensional arrays representing diagrams, recursion doing the same through a large tree with different paths that can have more paths inside, iterating over every path until I get some specific scenario. Really find the winner was one of the most difficult things I have ever done.</p>
